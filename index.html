	         <p>Here is a simple and effective indicator to see Kumo twists on Ichimoku.On the picture, I did just set an Ichimoku, and “Tenkan”, “Kijun” and “Chikou” as invisible.Just put the indicator, and set visualization to histogram.Happy trading !</p>

	        <h3>Morning CAC40</h3>
	        <p>Hello everyone,This small code looks a bit like my “Day Trading Trend DAX H4”, although it is less efficient.It takes positions on the CAC40, in M15 graphics, in the morning (hence its name), based on the current momentum, defined by a MACD on the last 14 hours (so the periods are multiplied by 56).14 hours because it’s like the 08H to 22H day trading.This code is profitable over the long term, logically.</p>

	        <h3>Fibonnaci</h3>
	        <p>Hello everyone !Here is a very interesting code and ready to debate.In fact, I thought I had developed a “perfect” code.And for good reason : on the GBP/CHF, it transforms (in 16.5 years),  10,000 € in 1.800.000.000 € in H1 charts, and in 1,000,000 € on H4 charts !The problem is that I forgot the spread.With a spread of 5 points, it falls to € 243,000 in H4 graphs while the performance is bad in H1 graphs !Fortunately, in H4 graph the progress of capital curve is very smooth, and with a leverage of 1.5 we go to 1.5 million € of gains, with a drawdown from 16 to 25%, still acceptable.And we can run this strategy automatically.Curiously, it is far less profitable than my own algorithms that are set in DAILY graphs ; the spread kills everything, I begin to understand why some professional traders say that they only trade on Daily charts…So here is the code.It plays with rebounds in trend, defined by a moving averages channel, and MACD.The code is optimized for the graphs in H4.It works on almost all pairs of forex, but need to adjust depending on the timeframe (variable at the entry and exit points).It required a lot of work from myself, I thought using automatic… but I will stay on my strategies in “Daily », which are finally far more efficient.Even the “Breakout CAC40” is more efficient from 2008 to 2016.Too bad, because the strategy seems very reliable and logical.</p>
